# Arkanoid Game

## Overview

This project is a modern implementation of the classic Arkanoid game, developed in Java as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course at Bar Ilan University. The game offers an engaging gameplay experience where players control a paddle to prevent a ball from falling while attempting to break all the bricks on the screen.

## Features

- Core Gameplay Mechanics

- **Paddle Control:** Players can maneuver the paddle using the keyboard's left and right arrow keys, providing control to deflect the ball.

- **Ball Dynamics:** The ball features realistic physics, bouncing off bricks, walls, and the paddle at angles that depend on impact position.

- **Brick Interaction:** Bricks are designed to shatter upon impact.

## Game Levels

#### Diverse Themes: The game includes unique levels such as Direct Hit, Wide Easy, and The Boss Level. Each level has its distinctive design, decorations, and challenges.

- **Direct Hit:** A simple level with a single target brick.

- **Wide Easy:** Features a wide paddle and a decorative sun-themed background.

- **The Boss Level:** A dramatic and visually rich level with building-like decorations and multiple obstacles.

- **Dynamic Progression:** Levels can be played in a specified sequence or in the default order if no preferences are provided.

Visual and Functional Enhancements

- **Score tracking:** The game keeps track of the player score. It changes dynamically both after a brick hit and a level completion.

## Game States:

- **Pause Screen:** Players can pause the game at any time by pressing the "P" key, with a clear message displayed.

- **Win Screen:** A celebratory screen showcases the playerâ€™s score upon successfully completing all levels.

- **Game Over Screen:** Displays the final score when the ball touches the ground and the game ends.

Custom Decorations

Each level incorporates thematic decorations, such as sun rays in Wide Easy or intricate building designs in The Boss Level, enhancing the visual appeal of the game.

Compilation and Execution

## Prerequisites

### Apache Ant: The project uses Apache Ant for building and running the game.

Installing Apache Ant

1. Download Apache Ant from the [official website](https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi).

     * Extract the downloaded archive to a directory (e.g., `C:\apache-ant-1.10.13`).

2. Configure environment variables:

    * Set `ANT_HOME` to the Ant directory (e.g., `C:\apache-ant-1.10.13`).

    * Add `%ANT_HOME%\bin` to your system `PATH` variable.

3. Verify the installation by running `ant -version` in the Command Prompt.

### Build and Run the Game

The project includes a `build.xml` file to simplify compilation and execution.

### Compile the Project:
```bash
ant compile
```
Run the Game:
```bash
ant run
```
Specify Levels:
To play specific levels in a chosen order, pass level numbers as arguments:
```bash
ant -Dargs="1 2 3" run
```
The numbers correspond to levels: 1 (Direct Hit), 2 (Wide Easy), and 3 (The Boss Level).
